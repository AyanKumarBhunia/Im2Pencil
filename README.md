# Im2Pencil
Pytorch implementation of our CVPR19 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08682.pdf) on controllable pencil illustration. For non-commercial research collaboration and demostration purposes only.


## Getting started

- Linux
- NVIDIA GPU
- Pytorch 0.4.1
- MATLAB
- [Structured Edge Detection Toolbox](https://github.com/pdollar/edges) by Piotr Dollar 

```
git clone https://github.com/Yijunmaverick/Im2Pencil
cd Im2Pencil
```

## Preparation

- Download the pretrained models:

```
sh pretrained_models/download_models.sh
```

## Testing

  - Test with different outline and shading stylesï¼š

```
python test.py  --outline_style 1  --shading_style 1
```

Outline style: 0 for rough and 1 for clean style
Shading style: 0, 1, 2, 3 for hatching, crosshatching, stippling, and belnding respectively
